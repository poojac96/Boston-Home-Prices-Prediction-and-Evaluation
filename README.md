# Boston Housing Data Prediction
 
                                                    Introduction
                                                                        
In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses in Boston’s suburbs.

Once we get a good fit, we will use this model to predict the monetary value of a house located at the Boston’s area.

A model like this would be very valuable for a real state agent who could make use of the information provided in a daily basis.
